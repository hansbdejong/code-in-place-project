Code in Place is a free online Python course hosted by Stanford University that has taught tens of thousands of students worldwide the fundamentals of computer programming.

In 2023 I built a new a new Learning Management System for Code in Place, which contributed to record student completion rates. Consulting with instructors and students, I designed an intuitive user interface to maximize student engagement. In addition, I created an innovative platform for easy course content creation and management with collaborative rich text editors.
